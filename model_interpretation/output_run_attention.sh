Some weights of EsmModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /ei/projects/c/c3109f4b-0db1-43ec-8cb5-df48d8ea89d0/scratch/repos/Soy_expression_prediction/replicate_AgroNT/sweep_logs/lr_3e-5/checkpoint-18856/ and are newly initialized: ['esm.pooler.dense.bias', 'esm.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
